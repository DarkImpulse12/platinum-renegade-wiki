The original post can be found here . Summary \uf0c1 Pok\u00e9mon Renegade Platinum is an enhancement hack of Pok\u00e9mon Platinum Version, similar to my other hacks such as Sacred Gold & Storm Silver and Blaze Black & Volt White . In a nutshell, this hack generally keeps the same story flow as the original Pok\u00e9mon Platinum but adds in a significant number of gameplay differences, including but not limited to access to all 493 Pok\u00e9mon in the game, revamped Trainers including tougher boss fights, lots of (optional) changes to weaker Pok\u00e9mon to make them easier to use, the removal of trade only evolutions and a number of other quality of life changes. The specifics of what parts have been changed are explained in the paragraphs below. Features \uf0c1 All 493 Pok\u00e9mon Available \uf0c1 All Pok\u00e9mon that were originally in Platinum, from Bulbasaur to Arceus, are available to obtain within the game. The wild Pok\u00e9mon for every single area have been modified extensively, now including species not ordinarily found in the Sinnoh region. It's possible to catch or obtain the majority of Pok\u00e9mon before facing the Elite Four for the first time, meaning you can construct almost any team you want. In the cases where a Pok\u00e9mon being in the wild would not be thematically appropriate - for example, starter Pok\u00e9mon or legendaries - new events have been added to the game to make obtaining these Pok\u00e9mon feel as unique as they normally would. The details for where to get each Pok\u00e9mon can be found between the wild Pok\u00e9mon and special events documents. Additionally, the correct locations for wild Pok\u00e9mon are also shown in the Pok\u00e9dex. (Big thanks to Mikelan98 for that feature!) Revamped Trainer Battles \uf0c1 The Pok\u00e9mon rosters of every Trainer in the game has been edited, now including Pok\u00e9mon from the National Dex. Trainer levels have also been modified to fit the new level curve, which is now higher than before due to bigger Pok\u00e9mon rosters and greater use of evolved Pok\u00e9mon awarding larger amounts of EXP. Trainers can now expect their Pok\u00e9mon to reach the 70s by the Elite Four, instead of the 50s that was the case in the original Platinum. Additionally, all Trainers use the AI that is normally only used by boss Trainers such as the Elite Four. The details for what each Trainer has can be seen in the Trainer Pokemon document. Please note that this feature is purely for the normal Trainer battles in the game; the Battle Frontier has not been changed. Harder Boss Battles \uf0c1 Important battles such as the rival, Gym Leaders, Galactic Admins or the Elite Four have had their difficulty increased further than normal Trainers. Gym Leaders and Elite Four members now always use 6 Pok\u00e9mon instead of the 3-5 from before, and all of these battles have them using high IV Pok\u00e9mon with custom movesets, held items, and sometimes ideal natures. The first round Elite Four and the Champion also have the unique property of randomly picking from four teams to battle you with, making it impossible to know in advance what their lead Pok\u00e9mon will be. They shouldn't be literally impossible to beat, but are definitely a much greater challenge than the original version. You can expect some of your Pok\u00e9mon to faint in battle unless you bring some strategies of your own to the table. However, they do retain their aesthetics from the original, including their type focuses and signature Pok\u00e9mon. Their signature Pok\u00e9mon are also now equipped with a Pok\u00e9 Ball seal for some extra flair! The details for all of these battles can be seen in the Trainer Pok\u00e9mon file in the documentation. Pok\u00e9mon Modifications \uf0c1 The Fairy-type from the Gen 6 games and later has been added in Renegade Platinum, replacing what was previously the ??? type. All Pok\u00e9mon have had their typing, base stats and wild held items updated to match what they are as of Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, meaning you can now use Pok\u00e9mon such as Clefairy and Ralts with their Fairy-type as in the later games. Pelipper and Torkoal also gain their new Drizzle and Drought abilities from Gen 7, and a lot of Pok\u00e9mon gain their Hidden Ability from Gen 5 and later as a secondary standard ability in this hack. All Pok\u00e9mon have also had their level up move sets completely revamped. Pok\u00e9mon will now learn their normal level up moves but now also learn other moves that enable them to be the best they can be, including TM moves, Egg moves and moves they only have access to in previous or later generations, up to and including Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! Some Pok\u00e9mon also get the chance to learn entirely new moves that they never could before, such as Megahorn for Pinsir and Earth Power for Typhlosion. The levels at which they learn the moves have been structured so that you can reliably access them just by naturally playing the game (i.e. you won't get moves at extremely high levels). Some Pok\u00e9mon have also had their TM/HM compatibility modified, in some cases adding in moves that they could ordinarily only learn in later generations (such as Drain Punch for Toxicroak), and other cases granting them access to entirely moves by TM (e.g. Drain Punch for Dusknoir). Additionally, several TMs have been replaced with new moves, including Scald, Wild Charge, Bug Buzz, Hyper Voice, Dazzling Gleam and Hurricane. Pok\u00e9mon TM compatibility has been adjusted to match their compatibility in later generations, or in the case of the newcomers Bug Buzz and Hurricane, my best generous guess has been made as to what might be able to learn them. There's also been much greater compatibility added for Fly, meaning you don't necessarily almost always need a Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon to get anywhere conveniently. In addition to this, there are also a number of custom changes to make certain Pok\u00e9mon unique and/or easier to use. Many Pok\u00e9mon who are a bit weaker have received buffs to their base stats, meaning previously weak Pok\u00e9mon like Butterfree and Ledian can now actually put up a fighting chance. Some Pok\u00e9mon with decent stats in bad areas have had their stats reshuffled, such as Glaceon who is now faster but less defensive. Some Pok\u00e9mon have also been given new types to play with, such as the now Bug and Dragon-type Flygon, or the Ghost and Fairy-type Mismagius. Some Pok\u00e9mon also gain new abilities that they can't ordinarily get, such as Weavile gaining the Technician ability. If you don't like the sort of changes that are listed in that last paragraph, there is an additional patch you can use called \"ClassicVersion.xdelta\" which will erase these changes from the game, leaving them the same as they would be as of Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. The details for these modifications can be found in the Pokemon Changes and Type Changes files in the documentation. Quality of Life Changes \uf0c1 A number of quality of life changes have been made to the game. All Pok\u00e9mon names are now decapitalised everywhere outside of standard NPC dialogue. This means in battle, the Pok\u00e9mon status screen etcetera, all names show up as they would in Gen V and later. Pok\u00e9mon natures are now displayed in the stat screen with their stat boost and reduction shown next to them (as stat highlights were not a thing in Platinum). For example, where it previously said \"Brave nature.\", you should now see \"Brave (+Atk, -Spe)\". All Pok\u00e9mon have their egg cycles reduced to 0, meaning they hatch very quickly. The Pok\u00e9 Radar is now given to you near the beginning of the game. The Bicycle is actually given to you at the start of the game. The Pok\u00e9tch, still given to you near the start, now includes all 25 Pok\u00e9tch apps right off the bat. Additionally, the three coupon miniquest has been removed. The Move Relearner and the Move Tutors that previously required Heart Scales and Shards respectively no longer require payment for their services; you can just talk to them and they'll do their job for free. Additionally, all three Move Tutors now sit in the same house on the southern part of Route 212. The Move Deleter is now available as early as Oreburgh City, meaning you no longer need to wait until Canalave City to delete any HMs. When fishing with a rod, an encounter is now guaranteed, as opposed to previously where it was possible to 'not get a bite'. Honey trees have also been given a total overhaul and now give you a Pok\u00e9mon instantly instead of you having to wait for several hours. The encounters for honey trees are different from before as they are now script driven - you can view what is on each tree in the Wild Pok\u00e9mon document. TMs are now effectively infinite; picking up or obtaining a TM will reward you with 99 copies of that TM, and these can also be refreshed by talking to a new NPC at the Pok\u00e9mon League. These TMs cannot be bought at any stores and also cannot be sold. Most TM locations have been reshuffled and can be seen in the Item Locations document. You will only find TMs from either picking them up off the ground or receiving them from NPCs. (It unfortunately proved impossible to make the TMs actually infinite, hence this method instead). The need to use HMs has been removed where possible. Surf, Waterfall and Rock Climb are still necessary, but Cut trees, Strength rocks (with one exception in the Distortion World), Rock Smash rocks and foggy weather have been completely removed from the game, meaning your Pok\u00e9mon no longer need to learn these moves to progress. Where roadblocks are necessary, NPCs have replaced them and will disappear when necessary. This does mean there are now some cases where you can access areas much earlier than you were previously able to do. Additionally, any darkness on the map has also been removed, meaning Flash is also no longer ever necessary. The Pok\u00e9mon sprites are those normally used in Heart Gold and Soul Silver, which for the most part look better than the Platinum equivalents. There are a couple exceptions to this where I've left the front sprite as the Platinum one for Pok\u00e9mon such as Blastoise, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Tyranitar and Togekiss. Additionally, the mini sprites used in the Pok\u00e9mon menu and the Boxes are now the Gen 6 icons (albeit some with some slightly off colours), with thanks to MeroMero for distributing a premade file containing them. Most of these changes are not documented anywhere, but you may notice them as you play through the game. Increased Shiny Rate \uf0c1 By default, Renegade Platinum features a new shiny rate of 1/512, meaning while shiny Pok\u00e9mon are still reasonably rare, it's significantly more likely that you'll come across one while playing the game. This shiny rate does not affect the Pok\u00e9 Radar's ability to generate shiny patches of grass, but does otherwise affect every other method of Pok\u00e9mon encounter (eggs, gifts, wild etc). If this feature is undesirable, there are additional patches included in the download that can make the shiny rate 1/4096 (equal to Gen 6 and above) or 1/8192 (equal to Platinum's normal rate) instead. Increased Gameplay Speed \uf0c1 The download includes a \"SpeedUpPatch\" which can be applied to Renegade Platinum which adds a few things to speed up the normally sluggish gameplay in Platinum. It does three things: all text will appear instantly, HP and EXP bars will no longer animate between positions and the 30 FPS cap of the game has been removed, allowing it to run up to a maximum of 60 FPS depending on the hardware capability. These changes together mean battles can go significantly faster. Please note that these speed up features are not included in the base Renegade Platinum and need to be applied via one of the additional patches supplied in the download. New Events and NPCs \uf0c1 A number of small events have been added to the game, including an additional event with Team Galactic, small events to obtain starters and legendaries, more in-depth events to get mythical Pok\u00e9mon such as Mew, Celebi and Arceus and more. Some new events have also been added that change the story flow slightly. For example, upon arriving at Eterna City, you will find that Gardenia isn't present at her gym. The player is instead required to make a short detour to Route 216 - which was previously inaccessible until gaining six badges - giving them the chance to pick up some Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon much earlier than before. Another example is that the player now visits Pal Park between going to Celestic Town and Canalave City. You also now battle Lucas or Dawn a few times as you go about your adventure! In addition, there are also some battles with each of the stat trainers (Cheryl, Mira etc), related to their individual events. There are lots of small events that allow you to obtain Pok\u00e9mon. For example, you can get an Eevee early in the game that is being taken care of by the player's mother. You can get a Lapras from an old lady in Pastoria City who has a small story to tell, and you can get a Beldum by talking to Steven, who is now taking up residence in Oreburgh City. And much more! There are also a number of additional NPCs that will do things such as sell you evolution items, give you items unique to certain Pok\u00e9mon such as the Stick, and a whole new training NPC in Solaceon Town's Pok\u00e9mon Daycare who will help you train your Pok\u00e9mon in levels or EVs, making any necessary grinding a lot faster. The details for some of these modifications can be found in the NPC Changes and Special Events files in the documentation. Evolution Modifications \uf0c1 Pok\u00e9mon that previously had to be traded to evolve can now evolve within the game itself. Those that evolve by trade and did not require an item now simply evolve at Level 36. Those that did require an item can now evolve by having the item used on them, similar to an evolution stone. Additionally, a number of Pok\u00e9mon have had their evolution levels lowered to make them easier to use. For example, Omanyte and Kabuto, who previously wouldn't evolve until a high level 40, now evolve at a much easier Level 30, allowing them to keep up with the other Pok\u00e9mon in your teams. Finally, some evolution methods were changed to be less restrictive. Pok\u00e9mon who could evolve from happiness at specific times of the day now just need to be happy, and Eevee, who previously required happiness and location evolutions, now uses standard evolutionary stones for all of its evolutions. The details for these modifications can be found in the Evolution Changes file in the documentation. Move Modifications \uf0c1 A number of useless or rarely seen moves have been replaced with moves from later generations. Examples include Draining Kiss, Scald, Icicle Crash, Drill Run, Moonblast, Dazzling Gleam, Disarming Voice, Bulldoze, Play Rough, Hurricane and Wild Charge. New moves borrow animations from other moves that are similar (e.g. Drill Run uses Horn Drill's animation), or have animations that are slightly modified from a different move (e.g. Moonblast uses Mist Ball with a moon background). These new moves can be learnt by level up or in some cases, TM. In addition to this, a number of moves have had their stats adjusted slightly. For example, Shadow Punch and Shadow Claw are now a much stronger 80 base power. HMs in particular have been boosted to make them more attractive as battling moves, such as Fly now having 100% accuracy and Rock Climb being a Rock-type move. The details for these modifications can be found in the Move Changes file in the documentation. Item Modifications \uf0c1 The locations of many items in the game have been shuffled around, allowing the player better access to them throughout the game. For example, the various evolution items are now found much earlier in the game, and can also be purchased from either the Veilstone Department Store, the Veilstone Game Corner or from an NPC in Snowpoint City. Locations for most items are shown in the Item Changes document. You'll be able to find items such as the EXP Share and the Soothe Bell much earlier than previously. TMs are now effectively infinite, as explained in the quality of life changes. Pok\u00e9 Balls, Great Balls and Ultra Balls have also been made cheaper to assist the player in what will likely end up being a greater amount of Pok\u00e9mon caught than normal. A few previously unused items are now used or replaced with new Key Items as well, relevant to new events within the game. Additionally, the previously event only Key Items such as the Secret Key, Member's Card, Gracidea and Azure Flute can now be obtained and their relevant events unlocked within the normal gameplay. The details for these modifications can be found in the Item Changes file in the documentation. Trade Modifications \uf0c1 The in-game trades found in Platinum have been adjusted to give you new Pok\u00e9mon that are otherwise hard to find at the stage of the game the trade is at. For example, you can now trade for a Spheal in Oreburgh City. In addition to this, the obedience check that makes traded Pok\u00e9mon not listen to you has been disabled, meaning you can use these traded Pok\u00e9mon with no worries. The details for these modifications can be found in the Trade Changes file in the documentation. Documentation \uf0c1 As you may have seen at the end of each section, there is documentation available in the form of text files for mostly every change that has been made in the game. The files are included in the download for the hack, but can also be viewed online at this link: https://pastebin.com/u/RenegadePlatinum. Screenshots \uf0c1 Tools Used \uf0c1 BTX Editor: Made by KazoWAR, this tool was helpful for getting some new overworlds into the game, such as Steven, a few of the legendaries and more. crystaltile2: An invaluable tool for importing/exporting/locating particular files from NARCs, as well as being very helpful when implementing the Fairy-type. Hex Workshop: Helpful for those times where I needed to do things via hex editing. JackHack Tools: A number of tools from his site were used, including a Pok\u00e9mon Editor, Attack Editor and Trade Editor. kiwiDS: Helpful for some cases where I needed to get the individual files for a NARC. Lua Scripts: A Lua script by Kaphotics that displayed the X/Y coordinate of the player on the map, allowing me to position overworlds correctly. PKHeX: While not used for actual development, it came in useful a few times to figure out how things worked. PokeDSPic Platinum: Used in a few cases where sprites had to be modified from their standard HG/SS versions. PPRE: Used primarily for scripting and placing overworlds on the map, as well as some text editing. Both 0.14b and 0.12 were used to get around the issues related to freezes caused when saving the script in 0.14b. SDSME: Used for editing text that wasn't tied to a map, as well as configuring the \"weather\" for places like Twinleaf Town and Wayward Cave. Tinke: Extremely helpful for some graphical changes, including the Steven trainer sprite and adding the Renegade Platinum logo to the title screen. I also used some tools that I made on my own to deal with the wild encounters and level up moves, as the existing tools had usability issues or bugs preventing me from doing what I wanted. These two tools aren't currently publicly available but I can hand them over on request, they're just a bit shoddy! Credits \uf0c1 Alpha, SCV: The creators of PPRE, which was incredibly useful. JackHack96: I used a number of his tools when building the hack. JimB16: For his Platinum disassembly on GitHub. While it wasn't used to actually develop with, it came in useful quite a few times to locate certain bits of data (including the solution for dealing with the traded Pok\u00e9mon obedience issue). Kaphotics: A very talented hacker in the data mining sense, Kaphotics' wealth of NDS knowledge helped me to avoid one or two potential issues as I was building the game; his advice was incredibly helpful. The Lua scripts for the player's position and the Instant Text code that is implemented into the \"SpeedUpPatch\" were both made by him, too. KazoWAR: For his BTX editor tool as well as his YouTube tutorial on adding Trainer sprites to Pt/HG/SS via Tinke. Markitus95: The creator of SDSME, which was also useful. MeroMero: Another extremely talented NDS hacker, MeroMero posted a lot of tutorials on Project Pok\u00e9mon that were directly relevant to things I wanted to do, such as changing the shiny rate or finding out how to adjust the position of Pok\u00e9mon sprites in battle. His tutorial for adding Fairy-type to HG/SS was also what I adapted to get it working in Platinum. Finally, the Gen 6 mini Pok\u00e9mon icons were also completely thanks to him (as seen here: https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/36081-gen-6-pok\u00e9mon-icons-for-gen-4-and-5/). mikelan98: An extremely talented NDS hacker, he produced lots of helpful tutorials for NDS hacking, and it was also him who provided files allowing me to show Pok\u00e9mon locations in the Pok\u00e9dex and for the Fairy-type icon to display correctly in the Pok\u00e9dex. Both of these would have been impossible without him! sylphate: A talented graphics artist who made the logo for Renegade Platinum. He's also the artist for the logo for my Rising Ruby and Sinking Sapphire hacks! I'd also like to thank my fanbase in general, who are always very encouraging and excitable. It wouldn't be half as fun to make these without you guys around! Known Bugs \uf0c1 The Union Room lady in the top floor of the Pok\u00e9mon Center has no text. Moonblast will not be usable if the user gets hit by Heal Block. Evolving a Wailmer into Wailord while in an area connecting to a Regi room will disable the warp into the Regi room until the map reloads. Gengar's mini sprite looks a bit strange on the Pok\u00e9tch. Some Trainer names may appear a little odd (double battles or the actual Frontier Brain battles in the Battle Frontier). Some trainers in the game (notably Dawn/Lucas) give you $0 upon victory. The event with Rowan's briefcase in his lab might act a bit strangely if you do it just after the Distortion World is completed. Download \uf0c1 The download for Renegade Platinum's patches can be found at my Google Drive at this link: https://t.co/pljSVD0yyG. The RenegadePlatinumV130.zip contains a few things. There's documentation text files, a patch to change a Platinum ROM into a Renegade Platinum ROM, and then some additional patches which can be applied to a Renegade Platinum ROM which can give you the classic version (less Pok\u00e9mon changes), increase speed and/or change the shiny rate. It also includes a recommended patcher called Delta Patcher Lite (which may only be usable on Windows - Mac users can try MultiPatch), a changelog for the game and some instructions on how to patch. There's also Readme files in each patch folder to further explain what each of the different files do and what you need to do to get it working correctly. If you get into any problems, make sure you've read the Readme files first. Generally, you will need to get a Platinum ROM (which you'll have to obtain by yourself), then use the correct patch for that as there's a v1 and a v1.1 of Platinum. After that, you can then apply additional patches to it with Delta Patcher Lite, but you may need to uncheck the \"checksum validation\" when using additional patches to be able to apply more than two of them to your game. The changelog and the documents are also available at that link if you wish to see them online.

The Pok\u00e9tch, still given to you near the start, now includes all 25 Pok\u00e9tch apps right off the bat. Additionally, the three coupon miniquest has been removed. The Move Relearner and the Move Tutors that previously required Heart Scales and Shards respectively no longer require payment for their services; you can just talk to them and they'll do their job for free. Additionally, all three Move Tutors now sit in the same house on the southern part of Route 212. The Move Deleter is now available as early as Oreburgh City, meaning you no longer need to wait until Canalave City to delete any HMs. When fishing with a rod, an encounter is now guaranteed, as opposed to previously where it was possible to 'not get a bite'. Honey trees have also been given a total overhaul and now give you a Pok\u00e9mon instantly instead of you having to wait for several hours. The encounters for honey trees are different from before as they are now script driven - you can view what is on each tree in the Wild Pok\u00e9mon document. TMs are now effectively infinite; picking up or obtaining a TM will reward you with 99 copies of that TM, and these can also be refreshed by talking to a new NPC at the Pok\u00e9mon League. These TMs cannot be bought at any stores and also cannot be sold. Most TM locations have been reshuffled and can be seen in the Item Locations document. You will only find TMs from either picking them up off the ground or receiving them from NPCs. (It unfortunately proved impossible to make the TMs actually infinite, hence this method instead). The need to use HMs has been removed where possible. Surf, Waterfall and Rock Climb are still necessary, but Cut trees, Strength rocks (with one exception in the Distortion World), Rock Smash rocks and foggy weather have been completely removed from the game, meaning your Pok\u00e9mon no longer need to learn these moves to progress. Where roadblocks are necessary, NPCs have replaced them and will disappear when necessary. This does mean there are now some cases where you can access areas much earlier than you were previously able to do. Additionally, any darkness on the map has also been removed, meaning Flash is also no longer ever necessary. The Pok\u00e9mon sprites are those normally used in Heart Gold and Soul Silver, which for the most part look better than the Platinum equivalents. There are a couple exceptions to this where I've left the front sprite as the Platinum one for Pok\u00e9mon such as Blastoise, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Tyranitar and Togekiss. Additionally, the mini sprites used in the Pok\u00e9mon menu and the Boxes are now the Gen 6 icons (albeit some with some slightly off colours), with thanks to MeroMero for distributing a premade file containing them. Most of these changes are not documented anywhere, but you may notice them as you play through the game.","title":"Quality of Life Changes"},{"location":"#increased-shiny-rate","text":"By default, Renegade Platinum features a new shiny rate of 1/512, meaning while shiny Pok\u00e9mon are still reasonably rare, it's significantly more likely that you'll come across one while playing the game. This shiny rate does not affect the Pok\u00e9 Radar's ability to generate shiny patches of grass, but does otherwise affect every other method of Pok\u00e9mon encounter (eggs, gifts, wild etc). If this feature is undesirable, there are additional patches included in the download that can make the shiny rate 1/4096 (equal to Gen 6 and above) or 1/8192 (equal to Platinum's normal rate) instead.","title":"Increased Shiny Rate"},{"location":"#increased-gameplay-speed","text":"The download includes a \"SpeedUpPatch\" which can be applied to Renegade Platinum which adds a few things to speed up the normally sluggish gameplay in Platinum. It does three things: all text will appear instantly, HP and EXP bars will no longer animate between positions and the 30 FPS cap of the game has been removed, allowing it to run up to a maximum of 60 FPS depending on the hardware capability. These changes together mean battles can go significantly faster. Please note that these speed up features are not included in the base Renegade Platinum and need to be applied via one of the additional patches supplied in the download.","title":"Increased Gameplay Speed"},{"location":"#new-events-and-npcs","text":"A number of small events have been added to the game, including an additional event with Team Galactic, small events to obtain starters and legendaries, more in-depth events to get mythical Pok\u00e9mon such as Mew, Celebi and Arceus and more. Some new events have also been added that change the story flow slightly. For example, upon arriving at Eterna City, you will find that Gardenia isn't present at her gym. The player is instead required to make a short detour to Route 216 - which was previously inaccessible until gaining six badges - giving them the chance to pick up some Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon much earlier than before. Another example is that the player now visits Pal Park between going to Celestic Town and Canalave City. You also now battle Lucas or Dawn a few times as you go about your adventure! In addition, there are also some battles with each of the stat trainers (Cheryl, Mira etc), related to their individual events. There are lots of small events that allow you to obtain Pok\u00e9mon. For example, you can get an Eevee early in the game that is being taken care of by the player's mother. You can get a Lapras from an old lady in Pastoria City who has a small story to tell, and you can get a Beldum by talking to Steven, who is now taking up residence in Oreburgh City. And much more! There are also a number of additional NPCs that will do things such as sell you evolution items, give you items unique to certain Pok\u00e9mon such as the Stick, and a whole new training NPC in Solaceon Town's Pok\u00e9mon Daycare who will help you train your Pok\u00e9mon in levels or EVs, making any necessary grinding a lot faster. The details for some of these modifications can be found in the NPC Changes and Special Events files in the documentation.","title":"New Events and NPCs"},{"location":"#evolution-modifications","text":"Pok\u00e9mon that previously had to be traded to evolve can now evolve within the game itself. Those that evolve by trade and did not require an item now simply evolve at Level 36. Those that did require an item can now evolve by having the item used on them, similar to an evolution stone. Additionally, a number of Pok\u00e9mon have had their evolution levels lowered to make them easier to use. For example, Omanyte and Kabuto, who previously wouldn't evolve until a high level 40, now evolve at a much easier Level 30, allowing them to keep up with the other Pok\u00e9mon in your teams. Finally, some evolution methods were changed to be less restrictive. Pok\u00e9mon who could evolve from happiness at specific times of the day now just need to be happy, and Eevee, who previously required happiness and location evolutions, now uses standard evolutionary stones for all of its evolutions. The details for these modifications can be found in the Evolution Changes file in the documentation.","title":"Evolution Modifications"},{"location":"#move-modifications","text":"A number of useless or rarely seen moves have been replaced with moves from later generations. Examples include Draining Kiss, Scald, Icicle Crash, Drill Run, Moonblast, Dazzling Gleam, Disarming Voice, Bulldoze, Play Rough, Hurricane and Wild Charge. New moves borrow animations from other moves that are similar (e.g. Drill Run uses Horn Drill's animation), or have animations that are slightly modified from a different move (e.g. Moonblast uses Mist Ball with a moon background). These new moves can be learnt by level up or in some cases, TM. In addition to this, a number of moves have had their stats adjusted slightly. For example, Shadow Punch and Shadow Claw are now a much stronger 80 base power. HMs in particular have been boosted to make them more attractive as battling moves, such as Fly now having 100% accuracy and Rock Climb being a Rock-type move. The details for these modifications can be found in the Move Changes file in the documentation.","title":"Move Modifications"},{"location":"#item-modifications","text":"The locations of many items in the game have been shuffled around, allowing the player better access to them throughout the game.

Locations for most items are shown in the Item Changes document. You'll be able to find items such as the EXP Share and the Soothe Bell much earlier than previously. TMs are now effectively infinite, as explained in the quality of life changes. Pok\u00e9 Balls, Great Balls and Ultra Balls have also been made cheaper to assist the player in what will likely end up being a greater amount of Pok\u00e9mon caught than normal. A few previously unused items are now used or replaced with new Key Items as well, relevant to new events within the game. Additionally, the previously event only Key Items such as the Secret Key, Member's Card, Gracidea and Azure Flute can now be obtained and their relevant events unlocked within the normal gameplay.

Hex Workshop: Helpful for those times where I needed to do things via hex editing. JackHack Tools: A number of tools from his site were used, including a Pok\u00e9mon Editor, Attack Editor and Trade Editor. kiwiDS: Helpful for some cases where I needed to get the individual files for a NARC. Lua Scripts: A Lua script by Kaphotics that displayed the X/Y coordinate of the player on the map, allowing me to position overworlds correctly. PKHeX: While not used for actual development, it came in useful a few times to figure out how things worked. PokeDSPic Platinum: Used in a few cases where sprites had to be modified from their standard HG/SS versions. PPRE: Used primarily for scripting and placing overworlds on the map, as well as some text editing. Both 0.14b and 0.12 were used to get around the issues related to freezes caused when saving the script in 0.14b. SDSME: Used for editing text that wasn't tied to a map, as well as configuring the \"weather\" for places like Twinleaf Town and Wayward Cave. Tinke: Extremely helpful for some graphical changes, including the Steven trainer sprite and adding the Renegade Platinum logo to the title screen. I also used some tools that I made on my own to deal with the wild encounters and level up moves, as the existing tools had usability issues or bugs preventing me from doing what I wanted.

Kaphotics: A very talented hacker in the data mining sense, Kaphotics' wealth of NDS knowledge helped me to avoid one or two potential issues as I was building the game; his advice was incredibly helpful. The Lua scripts for the player's position and the Instant Text code that is implemented into the \"SpeedUpPatch\" were both made by him, too. KazoWAR: For his BTX editor tool as well as his YouTube tutorial on adding Trainer sprites to Pt/HG/SS via Tinke. Markitus95: The creator of SDSME, which was also useful. MeroMero: Another extremely talented NDS hacker, MeroMero posted a lot of tutorials on Project Pok\u00e9mon that were directly relevant to things I wanted to do, such as changing the shiny rate or finding out how to adjust the position of Pok\u00e9mon sprites in battle. His tutorial for adding Fairy-type to HG/SS was also what I adapted to get it working in Platinum. Finally, the Gen 6 mini Pok\u00e9mon icons were also completely thanks to him (as seen here: https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/36081-gen-6-pok\u00e9mon-icons-for-gen-4-and-5/). mikelan98: An extremely talented NDS hacker, he produced lots of helpful tutorials for NDS hacking, and it was also him who provided files allowing me to show Pok\u00e9mon locations in the Pok\u00e9dex and for the Fairy-type icon to display correctly in the Pok\u00e9dex.

It also includes a recommended patcher called Delta Patcher Lite (which may only be usable on Windows - Mac users can try MultiPatch), a changelog for the game and some instructions on how to patch. There's also Readme files in each patch folder to further explain what each of the different files do and what you need to do to get it working correctly. If you get into any problems, make sure you've read the Readme files first. Generally, you will need to get a Platinum ROM (which you'll have to obtain by yourself), then use the correct patch for that as there's a v1 and a v1.1 of Platinum. After that, you can then apply additional patches to it with Delta Patcher Lite, but you may need to uncheck the \"checksum validation\" when using additional patches to be able to apply more than two of them to your game.

There's now a base patch to change your Platinum into Renegade Platinum, one each for the 3541 numbered ROM and the 4997 numbered ROM. You can then apply smaller patches on top of Renegade Platinum, including the classic mode, more normal shiny rates and a speed up patch to make the game faster. For details on applying these smaller patches, please see the README included in the folder with them. The base Renegade Platinum that you get after the initial patch uses what was previously the Complete and Shiny Boosted version (i.e. all Pok\u00e9mon changes are present and the shiny rate is 1/512). New Features: \uf0c1 You can now battle Steven when talking to him in Oreburgh City if you've defeated the Pok\u00e9mon League. A Hidden Power teller NPC has been placed in the Jubilife Trainers' School. He can tell you the type of your Pok\u00e9mon's Hidden Power (but not the power, sadly). The obedience check for traded Pok\u00e9mon in battles has been disabled. This means all Pok\u00e9mon - including those from the trades in the game - should listen to you at all times. Relevant dialogue has been modified to reflect this. Pok\u00e9mon now have their encounter locations listed accurately inside the Pok\u00e9dex. (Big thanks to Mikelan98 for this!) Pok\u00e9mon changes (both versions): \uf0c1 Spheal now evolves into Sealeo at Level 24. Sealeo now evolves into Walrein at Level 40. Aron now evolves into Lairon at Level 24. Lairon now evolves into Aggron at Level 40. Sealeo's level up move levels have been adjusted. Walrein's level up move levels have been adjusted. Lairon's level up move levels have been adjusted. Aggron's level up move levels have been adjusted. Glalie can now learn Rock Tomb by TM. Zigzagoon, Linoone, Gligar and Gliscor can now learn Rock Climb by HM (they have access to the move in Gen V onwards). Oddish, Gloom and Vileplume have had their level up moves reshuffled and Oddish and Gloom now learn Sludge by level. Changes: \uf0c1 The man in Celestic Town that gives you various \"glasses\" items now gives you all items when spoken to instead of an item depending on the time. The boy who talks to you as you enter Oreburgh City now gives you an Oval Stone (helpful if you get Happiny from the Egg you receive in the school). The item changes document now lists the location of key items. Bug Fixes: \uf0c1 Modified Maylene's dialogue when entering Route 217 to avoid the text getting cut off if the player's name was long. The rock that appears on Fullmoon Island now uses the Moss Rock overworld, preventing the player from destroying it by using Rock Smash from the menu. Fixed an error where the encounters for fishing in the wild document didn't match what was in game. Fixed an error in the wild document listing Floatzel as a 30% encounter at night on Route 213. Fixed a couple Trainers that had \"nd\" in their name instead of an ampersand (&). Fixed a couple Trainers who didn't have their rematch teams properly edited. Fixed a bug where one of Lucian's Pok\u00e9mon was the incorrect level. Fixed a bug where some Trainers in Victory Road had a Dusknoir and Banette incorrectly knowing Shadow Force. v1.2.1 - 18/01/2019 \uf0c1 Pok\u00e9mon changes (both versions): \uf0c1 Glalie can now learn Rock Polish by TM. Changes: \uf0c1 The NPC who fixes saves from the earlier versions now doesn't affect the Celebi event. Instead, you should now be able to interact with the shrine in Celestic Town again after updating to v1.2.1 and then subsequently get the Celebi event working. This does mean that people who already caught Celebi can get a second Celebi! Bug Fixes: \uf0c1 Fixed a bug where the Celebi event failed to activate. If you previously collected the GS Ball from the shrine, the event should work now. v1.2.0 - 14/01/2019 \uf0c1 New Features: \uf0c1 A scientist in the Berry Master's house on Route 208 now sells you Berries normally unobtainable in Platinum (e.g. Liechi, Salac). The Moss Rock and the Ice Rock have returned. While they no longer have an effect on Eevee, they will give you a Leaf Stone and an Ice Stone respectively. Added a \"Type Changes\" document that lists a justification for each type change as well as the types that are changed for any Pok\u00e9mon. Added a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" document that has answers to some of the more common questions received. Pok\u00e9mon changes (both versions): \uf0c1 Chikorita, Bayleef and Meganium now learn Draining Kiss and Moonblast by level. Totodile, Croconaw and Feraligatr now learn Night Slash by level. Milotic now learns Moonblast by level. Glalie is now able to learn Rock Slide by level and TM, and Stone Edge, Rock Smash and Rock Climb by TM/HM. Pok\u00e9mon changes (Complete version only): \uf0c1 Meganium is now Grass/Fairy type. Feraligatr is now Water/Dark type. Milotic is now Water/Fairy type. Glalie is now Ice/Rock type. Bug Fixes: \uf0c1 Fixed a bug where Ghost-type attacks were neutral effectiveness against Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon. Fixed a bug where Ghost-type attacks were not very effective against Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon. Fixed a bug where the NPC that upgrades your save was sometimes making the Celebi event not work. Fixed a bug where the Deoxys event wouldn't work by modifying the event slightly. This should now work on save files where it didn't before (if the League has been beaten). Fixed a bug where a pair of Trainers in Wayward Cave didn't see far enough to force a double battle. Fixed a bug where Volkner incorrectly used two normal Rotom in his Battleground rematch instead of the Heat and Wash forms. Fixed a bug where you could battle the Snowpoint Temple guards with only one Pok\u00e9mon, causing you to send out a glitch. Fixed a bug where an NPC in the Veilstone Department Store made a reference to giving you the Counter Pok\u00e9tch app, which never happened in Renegade Platinum. Fixed a bug where Combusken and Blaziken learn Fire Blast instead of Flare Blitz. v1.1.2 - 02/01/2019 \uf0c1 Bug Fixes: \uf0c1 Fixed a bug where Stealth Rock was doing seemingly random amounts of damage. Fixed a bug where talking to the new NPCs in the Old Chateau would crash the game. Fixed a bug where the Eevee in the intro of the game reverted back into a Buneary. Fixed an error in the Pok\u00e9mon Changes document listing Charizard with the wrong ability. v1.1.1 - 01/01/2019 \uf0c1 Bug Fixes: \uf0c1 Fixed a bug where the game would crash when interacting with the Galactic grunts that were harassing the Honey seller in Floaroma Meadow. v1.1.0 - 01/01/2019 \uf0c1 Breaking Changes: \uf0c1 The base ROM for the hack has changed from the 3541 numbered dump to the 4997 (4998 on some sites) numbered dump. This should match a dump from a genuine American Platinum cartridge (unless the cart was bought near initial release). Breaking Bug Fixes: \uf0c1 Trigger scripts (scripts that activate when you step in a certain place) have had their internal indexes changed to prevent potential bugs. The GS Ball now replaces the Loot Sack instead of the Shoal Shell. The Shell Bell item sprite is fixed as a result. IMPORTANT NOTE - TRIGGER FIXES If you're carrying a save file over from an older version, please immediately go to the Pok\u00e9mon Center in Eterna, Hearthome, Veilstone or Jubilife. Talk to the NPC in the center of the room to synchronize the state of the trigger scripts between the old and new versions. Failure to do so means you may see certain roadblocks start blocking you again, or certain events repeating that had already been completed. There may be some small hiccups if you're in odd situations with some events (e.g. the Mira stuff is only half done) but it should work okay. NOTE - GS BALL Due to the GS Ball now replacing a different item, you may find that a GS Ball that was in your inventory from a previous save will now be a Shoal Shell. This does not affect the Celebi event as that doesn't actually check for the item itself and just that you've picked it up, but you will need to do the step described above. New Features: \uf0c1 Pok\u00e9mon natures now also show the stat boost after the nature's name. (Thanks to @Bobtree1998 for the suggestion!) Remoraid is now able to be found in Route 208 (allowing an earlier Mantyke evolution if you get it from the Jubilife Egg). Rock Climb is now a Rock-type move, but has had its power reduced to 80. Rowan now gives you 10 Repels straight after giving you the Pok\u00e9 Radar. Sand Tomb has been replaced with the move Bulldoze from later generations and has been distributed accordingly. The big room in Iron Island now has a nurse who will heal your Pok\u00e9mon. The in-game menu is now decapitalised. The Move Deleter is now found in a house in Oreburgh City. The National Pok\u00e9dex now needs to be completed enough that you can view the diploma before you can obtain the Azure Flute to get Arceus. The Pok\u00e9mon Center nurse's dialogue has been reduced. You no longer need to show Gardenia a Snover to enter Eterna's Gym. Instead, you will need to find Gardenia herself on Route 216 before you can enter Eterna's Gym. Changes: \uf0c1 Dawn and Lucas now use Seals on their starter in the later battles. Roark, Gardenia and Fantina have had their teams adjusted slightly. The dialogue concerning the new section after Celestic Town where you visit Pal Park has been updated to make your destination a lot more obvious. The maid in the Old Chateau now only gives you an Old Gateau if you don't already have one in your inventory. Additionally, her dialogue has been changed. Traynee now lists her stat training options in High, Medium and Low order instead of Low, Medium and High. Traynee's stat training teams now use Pok\u00e9mon that will only use harmless moves and do not have status causing abilities. Pok\u00e9mon changes (both versions): \uf0c1 Illumise now learns Draining Kiss and Moonblast by level, but no longer learns Charge Beam or Thunderbolt. (It still can learn Thunderbolt by TM!) Leafeon is now compatible with the Cut HM. Monferno, Infernape, Azumarill, Electivire and Dusknoir are now compatible with the Drain Punch TM. Mudkip, Marshtomp and Swampert now learn Aqua Tail slightly earlier. Ninetales is now compatible with the Psychic and Shadow Ball TMs. Roselia now learns Sludge and Sludge Bomb by level, but no longer learns Leaf Storm. (Roserade still does!) Shedinja is now compatible with the Swords Dance TM. Swablu and Altaria now learn Moonblast slightly earlier. Unown's catch rate has been boosted from 225 to 255. Venusaur now learns Earth Power by level. Wailmer and Wailord now learn Body Slam by level, but no longer learn Thrash. Pok\u00e9mon changes (Complete version only): \uf0c1 Altaria is now Dragon/Fairy and has had its stats buffed slightly (again). Arbok has had a slight buff to its stats. Dusknoir now gets the Iron Fist ability instead of Frisk when evolved from a Dusclops with the Frisk ability. (This does not apply to Frisk Dusclops caught before the patch). Illumise is now Bug/Fairy and has had a buff to its stats (again). Sceptile is now Grass/Dragon and has had its stats adjusted slightly. Seviper is now Poison/Dark and has had its stats modified (again). Swablu is now Fairy/Flying and has had its stats buffed slightly (again). Typhlosion now gets the Adaptability ability and has had its stats modified (again). Vibrava and Flygon now get Compoundeyes when evolved from a Trapinch that has the Hyper Cutter ability. Volbeat has had a buff to its stats (again). NOTE - ABILITIES The new abilities will not retroactively apply to these Pok\u00e9mon if you carry over a save file.

IMPORTANT NOTE - TRIGGER FIXES If you're carrying a save file over from an older version, please immediately go to the Pok\u00e9mon Center in Eterna, Hearthome, Veilstone or Jubilife. Talk to the NPC in the center of the room to synchronize the state of the trigger scripts between the old and new versions.

There may be some small hiccups if you're in odd situations with some events (e.g. the Mira stuff is only half done) but it should work okay. NOTE - GS BALL Due to the GS Ball now replacing a different item, you may find that a GS Ball that was in your inventory from a previous save will now be a Shoal Shell.

If using a dump made from your own American cartridge, copies purchased near Platinum's original release should use the 3541 patch. Otherwise, the 4997 patch should hopefully do the job. Make sure you're trying to apply the patch to an .nds file (that should be 128 MB). It should not still be compressed in a .zip or .7z, and it definitely should not be an .exe! The patch to turn Platinum into Renegade Platinum should work without needing to uncheck the \"Checksum validation\" option. If you do this to force it through, it'll likely freeze in battles. If you are on Mac, consider using a program called MultiPatch instead (easy to find on Google). The Delta Patcher Lite tool will probably not work for you. Patching is a bit unreliable on mobile phones. I can't really help with problems there. You can search for prepatched ROMs online or use a PC then transfer the patched ROM to your phone. Why has my game frozen when trying to start the first rival battle? \uf0c1 This means you've likely used the wrong ROM base. Try the patch for the other ROM base. If you try to force the patch through by unchecking \"checksum validation\" in Delta Patcher Lite, you will probably also end up with this issue. If you have the correct ROM base, you won't need to uncheck the \"checksum validation\". How can I update my Renegade Platinum to a newer version? \uf0c1 Renegade Platinum save files are compatible between each version, so this should be possible. Most emulators link the ROM name and the save file together, e.g. RenegadePlatinum.nds would have a corresponding save file RenegadePlatinum.sav. Please note I am referring to battery (normal) saves here done by the save menu in game. Save states will NOT work if you change the ROM version! First, get an .nds copy of the newest Renegade Platinum. The patches must always be applied to a vanilla Platinum ROM. Export / Import Battery Saves (DeSmuME) \uf0c1 If using DeSmuME, you can export your current battery save by going to File -> Export Backup Memory in DeSmuME to produce a .sav file. Do this while playing the old Renegade Platinum with your current save file loaded. Open the new ROM, then do File -> Import Backup Memory and select the .sav you just exported. Your save file should now be active. The Filename Switch Method \uf0c1 Rename the new version of the Renegade Platinum ROM have the same filename as whatever your now old version file is. For example, if you were playing RenegadePlatinumX.nds on your emulator, and your new version is now RenegadePlatinumY.nds, you could rename that newer version from RenegadePlatinumY.nds -> RenegadePlatinumX.nds. Replace your old ROM with the new ROM. Boot up the new ROM on the emulator and hopefully your save file should be there. Please note that if you are updating from v1.0.0, v1.0.1, v1.0.2 or v1.0.3 to any newer version while keeping your save file, you will need to talk to the NPC found in any of the Pok\u00e9mon Centers in Jubilife, Eterna, Hearthome or Veilstone to get everything in place in your save. Can I randomise Renegade Platinum? \uf0c1 No, this is not possible via the Universal Pok\u00e9mon Randomizer. Expanded files mean the internal file locations are different to normal, and the Universal Pok\u00e9mon Randomizer is unable to handle this. This is impossible to add support for. You can however do it manually by transplanting files across from a randomised ordinary Platinum. Please see the How to randomize document for instructions. Does the boost to the shiny rate affect the Pok\u00e9 Radar shiny patches? \uf0c1 No, the Pok\u00e9 Radar works off its own RNG system that will force a shiny patch when it rolls the correct number. The shiny rate change in this game doesn't affect this. Can I get as a shiny? \uf0c1 Yes, all Pok\u00e9mon are available as shiny at whatever rate the version you're playing has (1/512 with shiny boost, 1/8192 if not). You need to soft reset to try to get shinies for static encounters; save states don't reroll the RNG so you'll get the same Pok\u00e9mon every time. I'm seeing graphical distortion when walking in grass sometimes. Is this a bug? \uf0c1 This is a bug, but not with the hack; it's a problem with the emulator (specifically DeSmuME that I know of). The graphical distortion is harmless and will go away when the screen is refreshed. This problem also happens with the original Platinum. I finished the Galactic events in Eterna City and am now stuck. What do I do? \uf0c1 Go to the Bike Shop in Eterna City and talk to the owner. After this, you should be able to progress past Route 206. Why can't I get into Canalave City? Where am I meant to go? \uf0c1 You must now visit Pal Park before you can continue into Canalave City. Be sure to talk to all of the NPCs at Pal Park. You're after a specific item to get past the guard blocking you! Where can I find the ROM base for Renegade Platinum? \uf0c1 Can't give you a link here, unfortunately. But they do exist on the Internet.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#why-is-the-patching-not-working","text":"Make sure you're using the correct patch for the Platinum ROM you've obtained.

Trainer battles, gift Pok\u00e9mon, TMs, field items and static encounters (legendaries) are off limits - you'll probably end up with crashes in places if you try to import these. You will also be unable to carry any text changes the randomizer makes across, so you may have issues in some cases where the text change is near essential (e.g. starters, in-game trades). This process requires the use of a computer (not a phone). This will work on Windows, I'm not sure about Mac or Linux (but if you can find an alternative to crystaltile2, that might work). Tools \uf0c1 You need the following things: A vanilla Platinum ROM A Renegade Platinum ROM The Universal Pok\u00e9mon Randomizer (available here: https://pokehacks.dabomstew.com/randomizer/) crysatltile2 (available here: https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/818/) Steps \uf0c1 Randomize your Platinum ROM using the Universal Randomzier as normal and save it. Open your now randomized Platinum ROM in crystaltile2. Click the icon near the top that looks like a DS (two left of the ? button in the blue circle) to open up the file explorer for the ROM. On any of these files, you are able to right click them and select \"Export\" to save the file to your PC. At this point, you'll want to export the files corresponding to the elements you've randomized. So again - find the relevant file in the list, right click it, select \"Export\" and save the file. The files are as follows: Next, open your Renegade Platinum ROM with crystaltile2. Again, hit the DS icon to bring up the file explorer for the ROM. When right clicking the files, you should also see an \"Import\" button as well as the \"Export\" we used earlier. Simply right click on the files corresponding to the stuff you want to pull from the randomizer (the names are identical to the ones listed above), click \"Import\" and select the .narc you exported for that file, and that should insert it to the ROM. After you've imported whatever you like, you should be able to just close crystaltile2. In my experience, it seems to save the ROM automatically, despite the message that pops up confirming shut down. Just close crystaltile2 and hit \"Yes\" to the prompt about being shut down. Pop open the Renegade Platinum ROM you just edited in crystaltile2 in whatever emulator you use and your randomized changes should be active. Caveats \uf0c1 As explained above, text changes will not carry across as Renegade Platinum adds a LOT of extra text strings as well as changing existing ones (move names, Pok\u00e9mon names etc) so it isn't feasible to do so. If you've randomized the starters, you will find that the pictures when selecting them in Rowan's briefcase will not have changed - the randomizer doesn't know how to do this. It does normally change the cries and text, but as we retain the original text, it means you're reliant on the cries alone to figure out what the new starters are. Good luck! If you've randomized the requested Pok\u00e9mon on the In-Game trades, then you'll probably have an extremely hard time figuring out what they want, as the text will still reflect what the trade originally was. If you've randomized wild Pok\u00e9mon, the levels of the wild Pok\u00e9mon will still be those of the original Platinum, instead of the boosted levels you get in Renegade Platinum. If this is a problem, you can instead use this AR code to get almost entirely random Pok\u00e9mon on each wild encounter: B2101D40 00000000 DA000000 000233EC D4000000 00000001 D3000000 00000000 D7000000 02FFFD00 92FFFD00 000001ED D5000000 00000001 D0000000 00000000 B2101D40 00000000 C0000000 0000000B D7000000 000233EC DC000000 00000006 D2000000 00000000","title":"How to randomize"},{"location":"how_to_randomize/#how-to-randomize","text":"Please note that you cannot randomize everything due to how the hack has changed things.

All Pok\u00e9mon have had their base stats updated to match Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. All Pok\u00e9mon have had their types updated to match Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. All Pok\u00e9mon have had their wild held item updated to match Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon (with some exceptions). All Pok\u00e9mon now have an egg cycle of 0, i.e. they will hatch extremely quickly. Wingull , Pelipper and Torkoal have gained their new abilities from Gen VII. Held Item Exceptions \uf0c1 Pok\u00e9mon who may hold an item in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon that doesn't exist in Platinum will not hold anything. Wild Pok\u00e9mon holding chance Item Corsola has a 5% chance to hold a Hard Stone Pelipper has a 5% chance to hold a Lucky Egg Absol has a 5% chance to hold a Life Orb Spiritomb has a 100% chance to hold a Smoke Ball Other Changes \uf0c1 Some Pok\u00e9mon have ability slots flipped (e.g. Scyther ). This is because enemy Trainers always use the first ability. Custom Changes \uf0c1 From the bases as listed above, further changes to any Pok\u00e9mon are listed below. These can include changes to base stats, abilities, types etcetera. Any changes marked with (Complete) are only found in the Complete version. This includes all base stat and non-canon type changes (i.e. types that aren't accurate as of Gen 7), and any ability changes that give an ability to a Pok\u00e9mon it has never had before (e.g. Weavile ). Likewise, any changes marked with (Classic) are only in found in the Classic version. All other changes are in both versions. Some Pok\u00e9mon have had a Hidden Ability from a later generation added as a regular ability (e.g. Ninetales). These changes are in both the Complete and Classic versions. Changes to movepools e.g. learning moves by level up or TM that were not possible before are also present in both the Complete and Classic versions.
